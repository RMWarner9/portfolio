			<h2>Short Biography</h2>
			<p>
				From a young age, I’ve been driven by a desire to help others and make a positive impact on the world. Growing up at my great-grandmother’s house, I had the unique experience of living in a home where four generations coexisted, shaping my strong family values. Early in my career, I worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant, where I discovered firsthand the challenges within healthcare and the potential for technology to improve patient care. This sparked my interest in creating software solutions that could address these issues. In the fall of 2020, I made the decision to return to school to pursue a degree in Computer Science, with the goal of combining my passion for helping others with the power of technology.

				<p>Seth and I have been together for 7 years. We just bought our first house last summer and have been enjoying the fruits of being first-time homeowners of a 100-year-old home. Thankfully, we are both handy and willing to tackle any challenge, so it has been nothing but a pleasure.</p>
