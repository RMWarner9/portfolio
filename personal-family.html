				<h2>Short Biography</h2>
				<p>I always had a passion for helping others and making the world a better place. My formative years were spent at my great-grandmother's house where at one point we had 4 generations living there at once!<br>
					My passions involve helping others and solving problems. In my early career, I worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant.
					Working in bedside care made me aware of some of the problems within technology and healthcare, and inspired me to look further into
					how to create software solutions. In Fall of 2020 I decided to go back to school and pursue a degree in Computer Science.

					<p>Seth and I have been together for 7 years. We just bought our first house last summer and have been enjoying the fruits of being first time homeowners of a 100 year old home. Thankfully, we are both handy and willing to tackle a problem so it has been nothing but a pleasure.</p>
