				<h2>Short Biography</h2>
				<p>Born in 1996, I am the youngest of my small family.<br>
				    I always had a passion for helping others and making the world a better place. My formative years were spent at my great-grandmother's house where at one point we had 4 generations living there at once! One of my earliest memories is changing my great-grandmother's bandages. My family is very important to me.<br>
				    What started as a pursuit in healthcare, later turned to computer science and the desire to work on making technology more accessible. During my time at Inglis, I found that there was a delay in making our every day technological conveniences, such as Amazon's Alexa more accessible to users who may have a diagnosis that makes it harder for them to use like Multiple Sclerosis. This observation made me eager to learn about how I could help solve this problem. <br>
